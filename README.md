Notes about the Datat structure:
-Home is the landing page. It has two parts: the NavBar on the left and the page on the right. The page contains the cards. By clicking on the cards, the card view opens the View.
-throught the navbar you can navigate to the form, the other groups and to the setting page
-groups looks like the home page but only certain cards are shown there
